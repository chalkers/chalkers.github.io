## Intro

Hello World, and welcome to That Maker Show with me, [chalkers](https://twitter.com/chalkers), your host to all things new in the maker movement.

This week we’re talking about DIY 3D filament colouring, creating shorter meetings, a MagPi’s birthday and an awesome kickstarter project.

## Ultimate Filament Colorer

Mathew Beebe [came up with a novel way](http://3dprint.com/3340/ulimate-filament-colorer/) of printing in colour with your 3D printer. Instead of buying several colours, which could be quite expensive, just pass your clear filament through the center of your favourite coloured Sharpie!

Mathew also says that passing the filament through the Sharpie before the extruder, cleans the filament. The ink cartridge of the marker consists of a fibre type material which catches dust particles quite nicely.

## You’ve had your time!

This week’s Weekend Project by Make is the [Bleeping Talk Timer](http://makezine.com/projects/bleeping-talk-timer/
).  Do you or your co-workers talk too much in meetings. Well in this project you can build a simple countdown timer that buzzes you when your time is up.

This project doesn’t require an Arduino and makes use of the 555 timer. Check out the blog post and video for more info.

## Happy Birthday MagPi

Earlier this week the Raspberry Pi magazine named the MagPi [celebrated it’s 2nd Birthday](http://www.raspberrypi.org/happy-second-birthday-to-the-magpi/).

[The MagPi](http://www.themagpi.com/) is a free to download and read magazine with countless tutorials and projects. For those of you who like the feel of a physical magazine in your hands you can purchase a copy too. In [this birthday issue](http://www.themagpi.com/issue/issue-23/) there’s £2000 worth of goodies up for grabs! 

## Kickstarter of the Week

This week’s awesome [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1756272518/attoduino-turbocharged-wireless-arduino-compatible?ref=discovery) is called the [AttoDuino](http://www.attoduino.com).

The AttoDuino has a built-in bluetooth module, battery management, and floating-point coprocessor. It can also be programmed wirelessly too!

If you need wireless and a little more punch to your Arduino projects check out their Kickstarter project now.
