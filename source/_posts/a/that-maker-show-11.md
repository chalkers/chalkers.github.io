## Intro

Hello World, and welcome to That Maker Show with me, [chalkers](https://twitter.com/chalkers), your host to all things new in the maker movement.

This week we’re talking about virtual reality hoverboards, musical disk drives, a littleBits Arduino module and an awesome kickstarter project.

## Story 1: Virtual Reality Hoverboard

Whilst there’s still a year for the Hoverboard to get invented, you’ll have to make do with a virtual reality version.

Over on the Hack A Day blog, [a post](http://hackaday.com/2014/05/22/oculus-rift-and-wii-balance-board-make-hoverboards-a-virtual-reality/) showcases a project by YouTube user [cratesmith](https://www.youtube.com/user/cratesmith). It’s a virtual reality version of a hoverboard using an Oculus Rift and a Wii Balance Board.

It’s great to see off the shelf hardware being mashed together to make awesome projects like this.

## Story 2: Musical Disk Drives

Sticking with the Back to the Future theme, YouTube user Arganalth [built a project](http://www.raspberrypi.org/back-to-the-future-played-by-disk-drives/) that combines an Arduino, Raspberry Pi and a mixture of floppy and hard drives to create an orchestra in a box.

The Pi sends information to the Arduino, then the Arduino controls the disk drives, which produce a sound. The result is an awesome rendition of the Back to the Future theme. Over on [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6wyBL1woclgGIfJdsUjbw) there’s plenty of other examples, so check them out!

## Story 3: littleBits Arduino Module

Snappable electronics kit, [littleBits have just gone digital](http://littlebits.cc/tips-tricks-arduino-module). littleBits allows you to create analog circuits by snapping magnetised boards together. Now they’ve released an Arduino compatible board for you to write your own logic and take your circuits to the next level and get digital!



## Story 4: Kickstarter of the Week

This week’s awesome [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magicbox/magicbox-magically-finish-your-3d-prints?ref=discovery) is the MagicBox.

MagicBox is a fully enclosed system to give a professional finish to your 3D prints. Place your print in the the chamber, the chamber becomes pressurised and acetone vapor smooths those rough ridges on your 3D prints. 

If you want to make a professional 3D print, why not back the project now!
