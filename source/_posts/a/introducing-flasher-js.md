The Internet of Things has the opportunity to tap into the talent of millions of web developers, __today__. It fails to do so because of friction.

If the tools don't improve it will never happen. I hate seeing wasted potential. I want to see what people can create given familiar tools - JavaScript, in a modern workflow.

Today marks our first step toward breaking down those barriers into IoT development with the release of __Flasher.js__. __Flasher.js__ is the first development tool by [thingsSDK](http://thingssdk.com). 

__thingsSDK__'s mission is to create a set of common APIs for Internet of Things devices in JavaScript. Ideally, the APIs could be reimplemented on any embedded JavaScript runtime or even in Node.js. The first step is making it easy getting JavaScript on to cheap, affordable microcontrollers. Then, provide the APIs and a modern workflow. 

__Flasher.js__ is a simple cross-platform app that allows you to install JavaScript runtimes (and others) to ESP8266 WiFi enabled microcontrollers.
