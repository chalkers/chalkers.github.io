## Intro

Welcome to That Maker Show with me, [chalkers](https://twitter.com/chalkers), your host to all things new in the maker movement.

This week we’re talking birthdays, slow mo video on the Raspberry Pi, laser etching experiments and an awesome kickstarter project.

## Arduino Turns 10

On March 29, it’s Arduino day celebrating the 10th anniversary Arduino platform. Has it really been that long? Anyway, both official and independent events are being hosted all over the world.

Check out the interactive map on [day.arduino.cc](http://day.arduino.cc) for your nearest event!

## Pi Camera Gets Slow-Mode

When the Raspberry Pi camera board came out there were two main modes supported. A high resolution stills camera with a 4:3 ratio and a 1080p 30 fps video mode.

Some engineers from Broadcom (the company who makes the chips on the Raspberry Pi) with the folks from Omnivision (the people who build the cameras) banded together to add some new modes on the existing hardware.

One of the funky ones is a VGA resolution 90 frames per second mode. Which slows everything down when played back at normal speed.

If you’ve got a Pi and camera board you should [test it out](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/6475)! When I got my 5s I was slow mo-ing all the time. It’s super fun!

## Etching Denim with a Laser Cutter

Have you ever seen those laser engraved laptops or smart phones? Ever wondered what else you can etch? How about jeans!?

Over on the [Hack A Day blog](http://hackaday.com/2014/03/19/etching-designs-into-denim-with-a-laser-cutter/) there’s a post covering the [denim etching experiments carried out by the folks at qbotics’](http://qbotics.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/science-with-denim/).

They found that setting the 75W laser to 15% power at 100% speed worked best for [Epilog](http://www.epiloglaser.com) laser cutter.

In the Hack A Day post there’s some more bizarre and dangerous uses of a laser cutter. Check them out to have your eyes opened! But I’d totally _not_ recommend trying those ones at home!

## Kickstarter of the Week


This week’s awesome kickstarter project is the [PiUPS or the Uninterruptible power supply for Raspberry Pi](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1842571016/piups-uninterruptible-power-supply-for-raspberry-p).

The PiUPS provides a clean power supply to your Raspberry Pi and can be connected and disconnected to the mains without causing a spike that could cause the Pi to restart.

The great thing is is that if you need more power you can chain more than PiUPS together! Sweet.

The project is already funded but if you want to get your hands on one for your Pi projects, head over to Kickstarter and help them out!

### Notable mentions

We’d like to thank [ADX Portland](http://www.adxportland.com) for being the venue for this show. We really appreciate them for opening up their space for us to use. You should check them out.

Hit me up [@chalkers](https://twitter.com/chalkers) on twitter if you have any stories you’d like me to cover. If they don’t make it into the show I’ll include them as notable mentions in the show notes.
