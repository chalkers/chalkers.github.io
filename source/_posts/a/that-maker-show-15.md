## Intro

Hello World, and welcome to That Maker Show with me, [chalkers](https://twitter.com/chalkers), your host to all things new in the maker movement.

This week we’re talking about the National Day of Making, print recycled material, printed tattoos and an awesome Kickstarter project.

## White House Maker Faire

Wednesday saw the [first White House Maker Faire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wHorfRvvcE). A number of people from the Maker Movement were there, from the folks at Tindie to Massimo Banzi of Arduino.

For what it’s worth, Barack Obama, declared that June 18th is the [National Day of Making](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/17/presidential-proclamation-national-day-making-2014). I say make everyday an international day of making, amirite?

## Print Your Waste

Black Eye Peas rapper, Will.i.am, in his role as creative officer at 3D systems and co-founder of Ekocycle, is [launching a PET plastic 3D printer](http://cubify.com/en/Ekocycle). PET plastic is normally found in soft drink bottles.

It looks like you’ll still need to buy spools of the plastic, but it feels we’re getting closer to the future where we can recycle our household waste and create useful things with it.

## Printed Tattoos

Over on [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-PRINTER-X-TATTOO-MACHINE/) there’s project that converts a MakerBot into a tattoo printer. It’s both scary and awesome at the same time.

For some designs this could work really well and would test you trust in technology! I wouldn’t get a tattoo anyway, even if it was a human or robot doing it. But it’s interesting hack...I wonder when we’ll see your MakerBot doing keyhole surgery!

## Kickstarter of the Week

This week’s awesome [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1537608281/lazerblade-the-affordable-laser-cutter-engraver) is LazerBlade.

LazerBlade is a kit based laser cutter and engraver. It comes in kit form and looks simple to put together.

It cuts and engraves wood, paper, leather and acrylic. It includes all the software you need and looks user friendly.

If you want to get etching support the project now.
