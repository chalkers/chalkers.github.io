## Intro

Hello World, and welcome to That Maker Show with me, [chalkers](https://twitter.com/chalkers), your host to all things new in the maker movement.

This week we’re talking about a DIY drink mixing robot, a privacy pocket, a drawbot and an awesome kickstarter project.

## Drink Mixing Robot

Want to build your own build your own automated drink mixing robot? Maker Yu Jiang, in [part one](http://yujiangtham.com/2014/05/25/build-your-very-own-drink-mixing-robot-part-1/
) of his tutorial shows you what you need and how to put the robot together. It costs about $180 to make the robot. His [next tutorial](http://yujiangtham.com/2014/05/30/build-your-very-own-drink-mixing-robot-part-2/) will go over the software side. Keep your eyes on his blog to see it when it comes out.

## Privacy Pocket

Adafruit’s Becky Stern uses a silver plated knit fabric to create a pocket or pouch for [the privacy contentious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH0zp1n5Zug).

Putting a your smartphone in this pocket will block WiFi and cell reception but it won’t block NFC tags. This is a extremely [straight forward tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/cell-phone-blocking-pocket) to follow and is a simple first wearable project!

## TRS Drawbot

Over on the MAKE magazine’s blog there was ]a project posted called the [TRS Drawbot](http://makezine.com/projects/trs-drawbot/). It’s a simple drawing robot with two servos that are controlled by audio output through a regular audio jack.

Just reading this project and watching the accompanying video makes feel that much more smarter!


## Kickstarter of the Week

This week’s awesome [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mrbeam/mr-beam-a-portable-laser-cutter-and-engraver-kit?ref=discovery) is Mr Beam.

Mr Beam is a DIY open source laser cutter and engraver kit. Mr Beam can be used on paper, wood, plastic, leather and other materials.

The endgame of the [Mr Beam](http://mr-beam.org/) project is to make laser cutters easy to use and enjoyable for everyone.
