## Intro

Hello World, and welcome to That Maker Show with me, [chalkers](https://twitter.com/chalkers), your host to all things new in the maker movement.

This week we’re talking about a Raspberry Pi Star Fox clone, DIY humanoid robots, Xenomorph cosplay and an awesome Kickstarter project.

## PiFox

A group of first year students at the Imperial College London came together and [created a version of Star Fox from scratch using the ARM assembly language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5n9IxSQH1M). It’s a bare metal project, meaning there’s no need for an operating system. The game is the only thing that’s running.

For details check out their [Github](https://github.com/ICTeam28/PiFox) page which includes a pinout for a NES controller.

## InMoov Robot

Project platform, Wevolver, [shared a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8KvCBOmXis) on the InMoov robot. It’s the world’s first Open Source 3D printed humanoid life-sized robot.

You can 3D print it and put it together yourself. This is really amazing! 

Go check out [the project](https://www.wevolver.com/#/project/54/parts/141/document) on the Wevolver site and see what you need to build it!

## Alien Cosplay

James Bruton of XRobots is in the middle of a Xenomorph Alien Cosplay project.

In his [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es7g0owDvdU) he shows how he printed the right arm, using Ninjaflex and ABS. In a previous video he did the hand. Subscribe to his channel for hint, tips and tutorials, including how to build your own Iron Man costume.


## Kickstarter of the Week

This week’s awesome [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2001363001/printeer-a-3d-printer-for-kids-and-schools) is Printeer - a 3D printer for kids and schools.

This 3D printer doesn’t need a PC, complex software or fancy configuration settings. All you need is an iPad, WiFi and your finger.

Children can draw their creations on to the iPad and send them to the printer. This looks like a great first step on the 3d printing ladder for young children.
