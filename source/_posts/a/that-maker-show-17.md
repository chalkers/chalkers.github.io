## Intro

Hello World, and welcome to That Maker Show with me, [chalkers](https://twitter.com/chalkers), your host to all things new in the maker movement.

This week we’re talking about DIY Gameboys, phones, crowd fabricated chairs and an awesome Kickstarter project.

## PiGRRL

This week Adafruit launched a [tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/pigrrl-raspberry-pi-gameboy?view=all) to build your own Gameboy clone called the PiGRRL. It uses a Raspberry Pi, a 2.8” TFT screen and a hacked SNES Controller. All you need access to is a 3D printer to print the enclosure. You can load up a NES or MAME emulator and play some 8-bit classics.


## FONA

Also this week Adafruit released their first cell phone module [FONA](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-fona-mini-gsm-gprs-cellular-phone-module). It can be used for voice, SMS and data. It’s only 2G but should be good for most hobbyist projects.

If you’re building your own smart phone or need your project to send you data this module looks like a great solution to your DIY cellular problems.


## Makerchairs

Joris Laarman Lab launched the [Makerchair](http://bitsandparts.org), a project to bring full size affordable furniture available to all. By breaking designs into many small parts they were able to radically expand the number of devices for the chairs to be made on. Basically, any consumer 3D printer. The 3D parts can be assembled into a piece of furniture like a big 3D puzzle.

Sign up to their project on [Wevovler](https://www.wevolver.com/#/register/Bits_and_Parts) to get your hands on the beta files.

## Kickstarter of the Week

This week’s awesome [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1359959821/mbuino-a-programmable-mbed-keychain) is the mBuino.

The mBuino is a keychain based microcontroller. It can be programmed with the online mbed IDE. You can select a plain circuitboard to a fully functional populated board. There’s even pads on the back there you can attach a battery holder for a coin battery.
