## Intro

Hello World, and welcome to That Maker Show with me, [chalkers](https://twitter.com/chalkers), your host to all things new in the maker movement.

This week we’re talking about building houses under 3 hours, printing food, gigantic neopixel rings and an awesome kickstarter project.

## Printing with Cement

A [few weeks ago](http://thatmakershow.com/4) I told you about a dutch architecture firm, Dus Architects, wanting to 3D print a canal house out of plastic – in Shanghai, WinSun Decoration Design Engineering Co. are printing with cement, and can [build 10 houses in under 24 hours](http://www.ryot.org/3d-printer-home-shanghait/641445).

The houses are fairly small at 650 sq feet and cost $4,800 to make. It’s quite interesting to see 3D printing bleeding into architecture and that skills learnt on the desktop are bleeding through there too.

## Food Magic

The same may be true of in the kitchen. [Natural Machines](http://www.naturalmachines.com/) have released details on their latest kitchen appliance, a 3D food printer called the Foodini.

The printer can be used to print sweet, savory and fresh food. Examples on their site include cookies, burgers, chocolate, fish and chips, sweet potato hashbrowns, pizza, ravioli and spaghetti.

They are currently [Kickstarting](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/456763017/designed-for-healthy-eating-foodini-a-3d-food-prin?ref=discovery) the Foodini now.

## DIY Ring Light

Over on the [Adafruit blog](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2014/04/17/60-neopixel-ring-camera-mount/) there’s a project that shows how to use their 60 NeoPixel Ring as a light source for your macro or close up shots.

The ring comes in 4 parts that needs to be soldered together. You can 3D print a mount to turn this ring into a camera light. The electronics enclosure fits into any DSLR’s hot shoe. Awesome!


## Kickstarter of the Week

This week’s awesome [kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1312527055/illuminated-raspberry-pi-safe-shutdown-switch?ref=discovery) is the Illuminated Raspberry Pi Safe Shutdown Switch.

This switch communicates with the Pi’s OS to tell it to shut down, once the OS finishes, it stops the power.

The project is already funded so it’s a sure bet if you back it you’re going to get it, it’s reasonably priced and what I like about these small projects is that it’s scope is limited so generally they don’t suffer from the same delays as the bigger projects.

## Outro
